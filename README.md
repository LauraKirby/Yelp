An implementation of the Yelp API.

Timing consuming issues: 
CocoaPods - A. I opened the project in as a "Project" instead of a "Workspace." I spent an hour trying to figure out what was wrong with CocoPods.  B. After the initial install of CocoaPods it didn't automatically work in my new project. I had an error with the bridging file until I created a CocoaPods file and library within the specific project.
