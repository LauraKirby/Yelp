Here is my Yelp API application. 

Outside of class, I spent a total of 14 hours on the assignment and groupwork - 8 hours on Yelp API, 1 hour on Twitter API, 2 hours watching the week four video, 1 hour on a silly Git problem, and 2 hours on the group project

Timing consuming issues: 
CocoaPods - A. I opened the project in as a "Project" instead of a "Workspace." I spent an hour trying to figure out what was wrong with CocoPods.  B. I think you have to use terminal to create CocoaPods within the each project. CocoaPods didn't automatically work in my project. I had an error with the bridging file until this step was completed. 

Just watched Tim's "Basic Twitter OAuth video." It looks like you do have to create a file and bring in the CocoaPods library with each new project.
